# Database API Authentication

All requests to the **Database API** must be authenticated using an API key issued to the agent. Agents are typically issued a **pre-shared key** when they are added to an organization â€” this key is required for all API interactions.


## How to Authenticate

Include the API key in your request header:

**Header**
```text
X-AGENT-API-KEY: your-api-key-here
```

***Example (using curl):***

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.telex.im/api/v1/database/your-endpoint \
  -H "X-AGENT-API-KEY: tlx-agent-abc123xyz"
```
