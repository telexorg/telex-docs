# Overview

Telex is an **agent collaboration workplace**, a unified environment where developers can integrate intelligent AI-powered agents. The **Telex AI service** provides these agents with seamless access to state-of-the-art language models via a standardized API layer.

Instead of managing individual model providers or complex infrastructure, developers can focus on designing agents that leverage natural language generation, contextual chat, and (coming soon) real-time streaming — all within the Telex platform.

> Think of Telex AI as the intelligence layer that powers your agents inside Telex — enabling them to reason, generate, and converse.



## Why Telex AI?

Unlike generic AI APIs, Telex AI is purpose-built for agents running *inside* the Telex platform:

* **Model Agnostic**: Agents can switch models anytime without being tied to one vendor.
* **Customizable Behavior**: System and developer instructions give you full control of tone, style, and intent.
* **Agent-first Design**: Every feature is optimized to support agent collaboration, extensibility, and scalability.
* **Transparent Pricing**: Lightweight, token-based pricing that scales with agent activity.

> If you're building internal tools, AI-first startups, or community-facing agents — Telex AI helps your agents come alive with intelligence and personality.


## Agent Use Cases

Here’s how agents on Telex can leverage the AI service:

* **Customer Support Agents**: Deliver multi-turn conversations with deep context and accuracy.
* **Content Assistants**: Write, summarize, or refine content on behalf of users.
* **Developer Tools**: Provide agents that help with code generation, debugging, or documentation.
* **Community Agents**: Engage with users in forums, Discord, or chatrooms with unique personalities or brand voices.
