# Installation and Setup

This section explains how to set up the Telex Start notification app for development. The app is primarily built and run on **Windows**, but optional instructions for **Ubuntu** are included at the end.


## Windows Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Required Tools

Make sure the following are installed:

- **Visual Studio Code**
- **C++ Extension Pack for VS Code**  
  - Open VS Code ‚Üí Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) ‚Üí Search ‚ÄúC++ Extension Pack‚Äù ‚Üí Install

- **Visual Studio Build Tools 2022**  
  - Download from [visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)  
  - During installation, select:  
  ‚úÖ Desktop development with C++

- **CMake** version 3.18 or higher. 
  - Confirm with:  
```bash
cmake --version
```
---
### Step 2: Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/telex-start.git
cd telex-start
```
---

### Step 3: Setting Up vcpkg
If you don‚Äôt already have vcpkg installed, run this at the root of the telex-start repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
git checkout <stable-tag>
bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```
Then install dependencies using the project‚Äôs manifest:
```bash
.\vcpkg\vcpkg.exe install --triplet x64-windows-static
```

Dependencies include:
- wxwidgets
- nlohmann-json
- cpp-httplib (with OpenSSL)
- ixwebsocket

These are defined in the project‚Äôs vcpkg.json which should be present in the root of the Telex Start repo.

---

### Step 4: Build the App with CMake
Open Developer PowerShell for Visual Studio, then From the root of the Telex Start repo, run:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/windows/debug ^
  -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ^
  -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%CD%/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ^
  -D VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static

cmake --build build/windows/debug
```
This will generate telexstart_d.exe in the build folder.

> üìÅ **Required file:** `CMakeLists.txt `
>
> This file defines the build process and links platform-specific libraries. Ensure it is located in the root of the project.
---

### Step 5: Configuration

Check for this file in the project root:
- env.json.sample ‚Üí Rename to env.json

This file will contain:
```json
{
  "email": "youremail@example.com",
  "password": "password"
}
```

> Replace with your actual telex login credentials.
---

### Step 6: ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App
Navigate to the build folder and run:

```bash
build/windows/debug/telexstart.exe
```

- The app will launch as a GUI application with a system tray icon.
---

## Ubuntu Setup (Optional)
Only follow this if you're building on Linux. Windows is the preferred platform.

### Step 1: Install Tools
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential gcc g++ cmake ninja-build pkg-config git
```
---

### Step 2: Clone and Bootstrap vcpkg
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
git checkout <latest-release-tag>
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```

Update the builtin-baseline in vcpkg.json using:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```
---

### Step 3: Build with CMake
```bash
cmake -S . -B build/linux/debug \
  -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake \
  -D VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-linux

cmake --build build/linux/debug
```
---

Once setup is complete, you‚Äôll be able to:
- Log in with your Telex credentials
- Fetch organizations and channels
- Subscribe to notification streams
- Receive and display real-time alerts
