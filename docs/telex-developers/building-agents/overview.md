# Overview

Telex empowers you to build versatile AI agents for a wide range of use cases. You can choose to create an agent specific to your organisation's use, or create an agent that can be used by all Telex users across different organisations.

AI agents on Telex are built using Google's Agent2Agent(A2A) Protocol. The A2A Protocol is an open standard designed to facilitate communication and interoperability between independent AI agent systems. In an ecosystem where agents might be built using different frameworks, languages, or by different vendors, A2A provides a common language and interaction model between all of them ensuring that your agent can seamlessly interact with other AI systems. For more information about the A2A Protocol see [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol Specification](https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/specification/)
