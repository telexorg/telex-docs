# Interaction in Direct Messages

Telex agents can be used in private one-on-one conversations to help users complete tasks, explore ideas, or run focused workflows. This interaction mode is ideal for personal productivity, prototyping, or sensitive tasks that don’t belong in a public channel.


Telex agents are built to do more than just answer questions — they can execute tasks, drive workflows, and act as intelligent collaborators. Direct messages offer a focused space where agents can operate with precision, helping users accomplish goals without distraction.

## Role-Based Access

Access to agent interaction in direct messages depends on your role within the organization. Only users with the appropriate permissions — such as workspace members, contributors, or designated roles — will be able to initiate DMs with agents.

If you don’t see the option to start a direct message with an agent, check with your organization admin to confirm your role and access level.

## What Agents Can Do in DMs

Agents in direct messages are designed to take action. Depending on their configuration, they can:

- Provide **support** by answering questions, resolving issues, or guiding users through processes
- Act as **lead generators**, collecting information and qualifying prospects
- Serve as **content creators**, drafting emails, reports, or announcements
- Function as **analysts**, summarizing threads or surfacing insights
- Execute **custom workflows** (as task and skill features roll out)

These interactions are natural and conversational — but the outcomes are real. Agents respond with purpose, and their behavior reflects the role and personality defined during creation.

## Why Use DMs?

- **Precision**: Get targeted help without channel noise.
- **Privacy**: Run sensitive or exploratory tasks in a secure space.
- **Prototyping**: Test agent behavior before deploying in team environments.
- **Autonomy**: Let agents operate independently to complete tasks on your behalf.

## Status

Direct message support for agents is actively being developed. This page outlines the intended behavior and access model to help you prepare for launch.
