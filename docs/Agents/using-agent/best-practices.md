# Best Practices for Using Agents

To get the most out of Telex agents, it helps to follow a few simple guidelines. These best practices ensure smoother collaboration, clearer communication, and more effective task execution.

## Be Clear and Specific

Agents interpret natural language, but clarity improves accuracy. Instead of saying:

> “Can you help?”

Try:

> “Can you summarize the last five messages in this thread?”

## Align Agent Role with Use Case

Make sure the agent’s role and system prompt match its intended purpose. A support agent should be empathetic and solution-oriented, while a content agent should be creative and concise.

## Use DMs for Sensitive Tasks

If you're working on something private or exploratory, start with a direct message. This keeps the conversation focused and avoids cluttering public channels.

## Test Before Deploying

Try out your agent in a DM before inviting it into a busy channel. This helps you refine its behavior and catch any unexpected responses.

## Keep Configuration Focused

Avoid overloading agents with conflicting instructions. A well-defined prompt and role lead to more consistent behavior.

## Encourage Team Adoption

Introduce agents gradually to your team. Share examples, highlight wins, and encourage feedback to improve how agents are used across your workspace.
