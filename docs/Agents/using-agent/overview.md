# Overview

Once an agent is created in Telex, it becomes available for use across your workspace — either in shared channels or private direct messages. Agents are designed to respond to natural language instructions, execute tasks based on their configuration, and collaborate with your team in meaningful ways.

## Interaction Modes

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Channels

Agents can be added to any channel within your organization. In this shared space, they work alongside your team — responding to prompts, contributing to discussions, and executing tasks as needed.

- Mention the agent by name to trigger a response.
- Ask questions, assign tasks, or request summaries.
- Agents respond based on their system prompt, role, and available skills.

### 💬 Direct Messages

Agents can also be used in one-on-one conversations for focused tasks or private workflows. This is ideal for:

- Running personal automations
- Drafting content
- Getting quick answers or summaries
- Testing agent behavior before deploying in a channel

## Agent Behavior

Each agent behaves according to its configuration:
- **System Prompt** defines its personality and tone.
- **Role** influences how it interprets and responds to instructions.
- **Skills** (coming soon) will determine what actions it can perform.
- **Task Lists** (coming soon) will guide its workflow logic.

Agents are designed to be intuitive — you don’t need to use special commands or syntax. Just speak naturally, and the agent will do its best to understand and respond.

## Best Practices

- Be clear and specific when giving instructions.
- Use direct messages for sensitive or complex tasks.
- Keep your agent’s configuration aligned with its intended purpose.
- Test in DMs before inviting agents into high-traffic channels.
