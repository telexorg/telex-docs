# Discover Agents

Telex offers a public [AI Coworkers Marketplace](https://www.telex.im/agents) where you can explore and activate published agents built for real-world tasks.


## How It Works

- Browse agents by category (e.g. Support, Marketing, DevOps)
- Use the **search bar** to filter by task, industry, or keyword
- Click an agent to view:
  - Description of what it does
  - How it works
  - instructions on how to use it

## Why Use Published Agents?

- **Instant setup** — no need to create from scratch  
- **Battle-tested** — optimized for real workflows  
- **Scalable** — ready for multi-user environments  

Whether you're automating ticket triage or generating reports, there might likely be an agent already built for it.


## Getting Started

1. Visit the [AI Coworkers page](https://www.telex.im/ai-coworkers)  or the agent marketplace in the workspace
2. Search or browse for an agent  
3. Click **Activate** to add it to your workspace  
4. Configure its prompts, tasks, and skills
