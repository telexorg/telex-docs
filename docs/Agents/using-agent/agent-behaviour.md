# Agent Behavior and Response

Agents in Telex are designed to behave like intelligent digital teammates. Their responses are shaped by a combination of configuration inputs and contextual awareness, allowing them to interact naturally and execute tasks with purpose.

## What Shapes Agent Behavior

Each agent’s behavior is determined by:

- **System Prompt**  
  The foundational instruction that defines the agent’s personality, tone, and role. This prompt guides how the agent interprets messages and frames its responses.

- **Role Configuration**  
  Roles influence the agent’s domain expertise and conversational style. For example, a support agent may respond with empathy and troubleshooting steps, while a lead generation agent may ask qualifying questions.

- **Interaction Context**  
  Agents behave differently depending on where they’re used:
  - In **channels**, they respond publicly and contribute to group workflows.
  - In **direct messages**, they operate more privately and can focus on individual tasks.

- **Task Lists** *(coming soon)*  
  These will allow agents to follow structured workflows, enabling multi-step execution and conditional logic.

- **Skills** *(coming soon)*  
  Modular capabilities that define what an agent can do — such as sending emails, summarizing threads, or generating reports.

## Response Style

Agents respond using natural language and aim to be:
- **Relevant** — staying on topic and aligned with the prompt
- **Helpful** — offering actionable insights or completing tasks
- **Context-aware** — adapting to the conversation flow

Agents do not require special commands. Just speak naturally, and they’ll respond based on their configuration.
