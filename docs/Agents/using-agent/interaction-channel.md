# Interaction in Channels

Agents in Telex can be added to any channel within your organization, allowing them to collaborate with your team in real time. In these shared spaces, agents behave like active participants — responding to prompts, contributing to discussions, and executing tasks based on their configuration.

> Channel-based interaction is actively being built and will be available in an upcoming release. This page outlines the intended behavior and use cases to help you prepare for launch.

## How Agents Work in Channels

Once an agent is present in a channel, it listens for messages that mention it directly or match its configured behavior. You can interact with the agent using natural language — no special commands or syntax required.

Examples:

- `@BudgetBot can you summarize this thread?`
- `@ContentGen draft a welcome message for new hires`
- `@DataScout what’s our top-performing product this week?`

Agents respond based on their system prompt, role, and available capabilities. Their tone, depth, and behavior are shaped by how they were configured during creation.

## What Agents Can Do

Depending on their setup, agents may:

- Answer questions
- Summarize threads or conversations
- Generate content or templates
- Provide insights or suggestions
- Trigger workflows (as skills and tasks become available)

## Collaboration Etiquette

To get the most out of agents in channels:

- Be clear and specific when asking for help
- Mention the agent by name to ensure it responds
- Avoid overlapping requests in busy threads
- Use direct messages for sensitive or complex tasks

Agents are designed to enhance collaboration, not disrupt it — so they’ll respond thoughtfully and stay aligned with the flow of conversation.

## Visibility and Access

All members of a channel can see and interact with agents added to that space. Responses are public and threaded, making it easy for teams to follow along or build on the agent’s output.
