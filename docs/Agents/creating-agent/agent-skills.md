title: Adding Skills to Agents

# Skills

Skills are modular capabilities that agents can use to perform specific actions. Think of them as plug-and-play tools — like sending an email, generating a report, or analyzing data — that can be added to an agent based on its role.

In the upcoming release, Telex will allow you to assign skills to agents during creation or editing, enabling more specialized and powerful behavior. This section outlines the vision for skills and how they’ll enhance agent functionality.
