# Agent Prompts

Prompts are pre-defined messages and conversation starters that help guide interactions with your AI agent. Adding appropriate prompts helps users understand how to effectively communicate with your agent and ensures consistent, high-quality interactions.

## Adding Prompts Through the UI

1. **Navigate to Your Agent**: Go to the **AI Coworkers** section and select the agent you want to configure.

2. **Access Prompt Settings**: In the agent configuration page, locate and click on the **Prompts** tab.

3. **Add New Prompt**: Click the "Add Prompt" button to create a new prompt.

## Types of Prompts

### 1. Personality Prompts

- Define your agent's character, tone, and behavioral traits
- Set consistent communication style
- Example: "You are a friendly customer service agent who always maintains a professional tone"

### 2. Tagged Prompts

- Categorized prompts for specific use cases or topics
- Help organize and filter prompts by purpose
- Examples:
  - #support: "How can I help you with your account today?"
  - #sales: "Would you like to learn about our premium features?"
  - #technical: "What technical issue are you experiencing?"

### 3. Other Prompt Types

- **Greeting**: First message when starting a conversation (e.g., "Hello! I'm your AI assistant. How can I help you today?")
- **Fallback**: Response when agent doesn't understand the input (e.g., "I apologize, but I'm not sure I understood. Could you rephrase that?")
- **Examples**: Sample interactions showing the agent's capabilities (e.g., "Try asking: 'What are your main features?' or 'How do I create a new project?'")
- **Context**: Background information for specific scenarios (e.g., "I am configured to help with project management tasks and team coordination.")

## Best Practices for Creating Prompts

1. **Keep it Clear and Concise**

   - Write prompts that are easy to understand
   - Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
   - Use natural, conversational language

2. **Maintain Consistency**

   - Ensure prompts align with your agent's personality
   - Use consistent terminology across all prompts
   - Keep a uniform tone and style

3. **Provide Guidance**

   - Include clear examples of how to interact with the agent
   - Show the types of questions or commands the agent can handle
   - Demonstrate the expected format for specific requests

4. **Update Regularly**
   - Review and update prompts based on user interactions
   - Add new prompts for common user scenarios
   - Refine existing prompts to improve clarity and effectiveness

## Testing Your Prompts

Before deploying your agent with new prompts:

1. **Preview Mode**: Test how prompts appear in actual conversations
2. **User Perspective**: Review prompts from an end-user's viewpoint
3. **Feedback Loop**: Collect and incorporate user feedback on prompt effectiveness

Remember that well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the user experience and make your agent more effective at its intended tasks.
