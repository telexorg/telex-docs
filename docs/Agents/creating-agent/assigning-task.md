title: Assigning Tasks to Agents

# Tasks

Tasks define what an agent is expected to do. In Telex, tasks will soon allow you to outline specific actions or workflows that an agent should follow — whether it's responding to a message, summarizing a thread, or initiating a process.

Each task will be structured and configurable, giving you control over how agents behave in different contexts. While this feature is still under development, this section provides a conceptual overview of how tasks will work and how they’ll integrate into agent creation.
