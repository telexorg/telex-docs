# Overview

Telex empowers your organization to create intelligent, configurable AI agents that collaborate with your team and automate workflows across a wide range of use cases. These agents are designed to act as digital teammates — capable of handling tasks, responding to instructions, and contributing meaningfully to your workspace.

Each agent is built through a simple creation flow in the Telex UI. You define its purpose, personality, and behavior by writing a system prompt and configuring a few key properties. From there, Telex AI handles the rest — enabling your agent to operate through structured **task lists** and modular **skills** that perform real actions like sending emails, analyzing data, or generating content.

Agents can be designed for private or public use within your organization and collaborate through two main interfaces:
- **Channels** — shared spaces where agents work alongside your team
- **Direct Messages** — one-on-one interactions for focused tasks or private workflows

Whether you're building a support assistant, a content generator, or a data analyst, Telex agents are flexible enough to handle anything from simple tasks to complex workflows — helping your team move faster, think bigger, and do more.


## Creating Agents: A Quick Preview

Creating an agent in Telex is a guided, intuitive process which involve 3 main process:

1. **Define the Agent's Identity**  
   Start by giving your agent a name, role, and personality using a system prompt.

2. **Assign Tasks**  
   Choose what your agent should be able to do — from responding to messages to executing workflows.

3. **Add Skills**  
   Equip your agent with modular skills that enable it to perform specific actions like sending emails, summarizing threads, or generating reports.

Once created, your agent is ready to collaborate in channels or direct messages, responding naturally to your team and executing tasks as configured.
