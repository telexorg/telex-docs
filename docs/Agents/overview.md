# Overview

Telex empowers organizations to build intelligent, configurable AI agents that act as digital teammates — capable of collaborating with teams and automating workflows across a wide range of use cases.

Agents are created entirely through the Telex UI, giving organizations full control over their design and behavior. From defining their role and personality to assigning task lists and modular skills, each agent is tailored to perform specific actions — whether it's sending emails, analyzing data, or generating content. No backend setup is required.

Agents operate through natural language interaction and structured task execution, making them versatile tools for both simple and complex workflows.

### Where Agents Work

Agents collaborate through two main interfaces:
- **[Channels](../using-telex/workspace/channels)** — shared spaces where agents work alongside your team
- **[Direct Messages](../using-telex/workspace/direct-messages)** — one-on-one interactions for focused tasks or private workflows

### What’s Ahead

This section covers:
- **[Creating Agents](./creating_agents)** — how to define roles, personalities, and capabilities
- **[Using Agents](./using_agents)** — how agents behave in channels and DMs, and how they execute tasks

Telex agents are designed to help your organization move faster, think bigger, and do more — all with the flexibility to shape them exactly how you need.
