# Overview

Telex empowers you to build intelligent, configurable AI agents that collaborate with your team and automate workflows across a wide range of use cases. Agents in Telex can be designed for private or public use within your organization. Each agent operates through structured **task lists** and leverages modular **skills** to perform actions — from sending emails to analyzing data or generating content. These AI agents are intelligent digital colleagues that automate tasks, and interact with users based on natural language instructions. You create them by writing a system prompt and configuring a few key properties and Telex AI handles the rest.


Agents collaboration are done through two main interfaces:
- **Channels** — shared spaces where agents can work alongside your team
- **Direct Messages** — one-on-one interactions for focused tasks or private workflows

Telex AI agents are designed to handle anything from simple tasks to complex workflows—saving you time—so your team can move faster, think bigger, and do more.
