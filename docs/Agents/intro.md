# Introduction

Telex empowers organizations to build intelligent, configurable agents that act as AI Coworkers — capable of collaborating with teams and automating workflows across a wide range of use cases.

These agents are created entirely through the Telex UI, giving organizations full control over their design and behavior. From defining their role and personality to assigning task lists and modular skills needed to execute their workflows. Each agent is tailored to perform specific actions — whether it's handling emails, analyzing data, or generating content. No backend setup is required.

Agents operate through natural language interaction and structured task execution using workflows, making them versatile tools for both simple and complex tasks.

## How Agents work
Agents execute tasks through workflows. These workflows are designed to be autogenerated based on your agents task list and skills.

## Agent Behavior

Each agent behaves according to its configuration:
- **System Prompt** defines its personality, tone and behaviour.
- **Role** influences how it interprets and responds to instructions.
- **Task Lists** (coming soon) will determine what actions it should perorm and guide its workflow logic.
- **Skills** (coming soon) will provide it with tools or capabilities to perform its tasks.

Agents are designed to be intuitive — you don’t need to use special commands or syntax. They are designed to help your organization move faster, think bigger, and do more — all with the flexibility to shape them exactly how you need.

## Where Agents Work

Agents collaborate through two main interfaces:
- **[Channels](../using-telex/workspace/channels)** — shared spaces where agents work alongside your team (Coming Soon)
- **[Direct Messages](../using-telex/workspace/direct-messages)** — one-on-one interactions for focused tasks or private workflows

## What's Next

This section covers:
- **[Creating Agents](./creating-agent/overview.md)** — how to create new agents, define their roles, personalities, and capabilities
- **[Using Agents](./using-agent/overview.md)** — how agents behave in channels and DMs, how they execute tasks and how to utilize them effectively.
