# QuickStart

To get started quickly, visit the [AI Coworkers Page](https://www.telex.im/ai-coworkers) to browse ready-to-use and add agents across support, marketing, engineering, and more.

Each agent includes:
- Its name and role
- A short description of what it does
- How it works
- What it does

Use the search bar to filter by task or category. Once you find an agent you find an agent suitable for your use case, and click the **Add to your team** button to add it instantly to your workspace.

## Configure Your Agent
Once you add an agent to your workspace, it becomes available for interaction but cannot perform any tasks yet. To make it functional, you’ll need to configure:

- Prompts: Define how the agent responds to users or triggers
- Tasks: Set up what the agent should do (e.g. summarize, notify, tag)
- Skills: Attach modular capabilities that power each task

To do this, from the sidebar click on:

AI Coworkers → Browse Colleagues -- to locate the page below:

![Agent Configuration](/img/agent-browse.png)


On the list available agents find your agent and click on the `→` button to view the agents configuration page below:

![Agent Configuration](/img/agent-config.png)

From this page, you can click on any of these tabs below to configure:
- **[Prompts](./creating-agent/prompts.md)**: Define how the agent responds or behaves.
- **[Task List](./creating-agent/assigning-task.md)**: List up what the agent should do (e.g. Read gmail and store the results in #all_emails channel)
- **[Skills](./creating-agent/agent-skills.md)**: Attach modular capabilities that will power your agent’s tasks
