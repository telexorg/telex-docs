# Welcome to Telex

Welcome to the Telex API documentation! Telex is an all-in-one monitoring solution for DevOps and Software teams. You can utilize Telex to monitor databases, file systems, websites, and logs. Telex builds on a very simple idea â€” HTTP webhooks that can receive data from anywhere. Telex is optimized for bulk data ingestion owing to its robust infrastructure. This means Telex will not introduce any performance issues if it is integrated into your product.

## The Core of Telex

The fundamental unit of the Telex platform is a channel. Every message that goes in or out of Telex must pass through a channel. Users in a Telex organisation can be added or removed from channels, making them useful for separating concerns. A channel can serve as a routing mechanism to direct messages like application errors to your team's communication platform like Slack or Microsoft Teams. You could also just use a channel directly for regular team chat and not have to pay for other tools. There are several other details about channels that if discussed would fill out this introduction, so it's best to continue reading about it on the [dedicated channel docs page](/docs/Channels/intro.md).

## Getting Started

To get started with Telex, create an account at https://telex.im/auth/sign-up. You will be prompted to create an organization upon signup. Once that is done, you should proceed to create your first channel and send your first webhook message.

### Messages on Telex channels

Telex by default can serve as a chat application for teams. Once a message enters a channel, all team members present in that channel receive the message in real time. This also means that when a third-party like a bash script calling the channel's webhook or a custom agent sends a message to the channel, all subscribed members and tools receive the message in real time.

The gif below showcases the process of registering a new account on Telex and sending your first message.

### Webhooks on Telex


Telex is designed for webhook events and retransmission. It allows you log events as they occur without strict rate limiting. Say you desire to see new signups on Slack and email simultaneously, you could achieve this by activating the existing Slack and Email agents on a channel. Doing this saves you the stress of creating a new Slack app or dealing with SMTP and the likes. An agent handles it all for you through Telex! The only requirement is you calling the Webhook URL of the channel where you activated the agents.  

Telex's design allows you to collect any type of event from your application and send them to downstream systems like Slack, Discord, Teams, etc.

There are tons of creative ways to use Telex, and its beauty ultimately lies in the freedom of building custom agents. You can build a simple app that connects to the Telex system and modify data coming into channels. You can also build an app that can transmit data to Telex at set intervals. Telex maintains the timing and your app simply responds when Telex calls it. Get started by building your first agent.
