# Welcome to Telex

Telex is a collaboration workspace where modern organizations pair human insight with intelligent agents to move faster, stay aligned, and execute at scale.
Built for fluid communication like Slack but designed for action — Telex brings AI coworkers into the conversation. They don’t just answer questions; they take action. Telex agents can generate documents, interact with systems, analyze data, and coordinate workflows using a growing ecosystem of purpose-built skills  — each designed to equip agents with the capabilities they need to complete specific tasks. The platform is extensible, allowing developers to build and customize skills to suit evolving needs.

Whether you're running a startup, scaling a business, or managing enterprise operations, Telex transforms how your organization works — with humans and agents collaborating side by side in one unified space.

## Agents - Your AI Coworkers

Telex agents are more than automation tools — they’re AI coworkers designed to work alongside your team. You interact with them just like you would a human colleague. Each AI coworker is designed with a clear purpose, a structured task list, and a set of skills. You define what they do, how they behave, and what tools they use. No matter your organization's needs, Telex lets you delegate work to agents that never sleep, forget, or burn out.

Each AI coworker is:
- Role-driven: You define its job (e.g., blogger, analyst, recruiter)
- Task-configured: You specify what it should do
- Skill-enabled: You equip it with tools to complete tasks
- Autonomous: It responds to data, prompts, and events in real time

## Working with Your AI Coworkers

Collaboration in Telex happens through two main interfaces: **channels** and **direct messages**.
- In channels, you can activate one or more agents to handle specific responsibilities and interact with your team.
- Through direct messages, you can engage with AI coworkers one-on-one for focused tasks or private workflows.

**Agents are:**

* **Configurable**: You define their role, tone, and task list
* **Skillful**: They use integrations (called skills) to perform actions


### Agent Tasks 

Tasks are the foundation of agent behavior. You configure what your agent should do using a clear, structured task list — no coding required. Each task is powered by an internal workflow, but you don’t need to manage that directly. You focus on defining the task list for your agent, and Telex handles the orchestration behind the scenes.

For example, a blogger agent might have the following task list:
- Suggest trending topics
- Generate article outlines
- Create header images
- Analyze SEO performance

You define the tasks. Telex runs the workflows. Your agent delivers the results.

### Agent Skills

Skills are modular tools that agents use to complete tasks. They’re custom integrations — reusable across agents but built for specific purposes. You can assign multiple skills to an agent depending on its role.

While tasks define what your agent should do, skills provide the how — the capabilities it needs to execute those tasks effectively.

For example, a blogger agent might use:
- A Topic Discovery Skill to surface trending ideas
- An Image Generation Skill to create visuals for posts
- An SEO Analyzer Skill to optimize content performance

Skills can be internal utilities, external APIs, or even LLM-powered sub-agents — all working together to support your AI coworker.
