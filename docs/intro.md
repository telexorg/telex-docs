# Welcome to Telex

Telex is an AI and human collaboration workspace built for modern organizations or teams who want to move fast, stay aligned, and get more done — together. Like Slack, it’s built for fast, fluid communication. But here, you’re not just chatting with teammates. You’re also working alongside AI coworkers who are ready to help get things done.  It’s designed for teams who want to move faster, think bigger, and collaborate more deeply. Whether you're a startup founder juggling a dozen priorities, a product manager coordinating across functions, or a researcher diving into complex problems, Telex helps you get more done by pairing human insight with intelligent agents.

You’ll chat, brainstorm ideas, make decisions, and carry out tasks, — all in one place, with both teammates and agents working side by side.

## Agents - Your AI Coworkers

Telex provides you with agents — AI coworkers that work alongside your team to automate tasks, manage data, and support operations across your organization. They’re called coworkers because you interact with them just like you would a human colleague.
Each AI coworker is designed with a clear purpose, a structured task list, and a set of skills. You define what they do, how they behave, and what tools they use. Whether you're running a media company, a logistics firm, or a government agency, Telex lets you delegate work to agents that never sleep, forget, or burn out.

Each AI coworker is:
- Role-driven: You define its job (e.g., blogger, analyst, recruiter)
- Task-configured: You specify what it should do
- Skill-enabled: You equip it with tools to complete tasks
- Autonomous: It responds to data, prompts, and events in real time

## Working with Your AI Coworkers

Collaboration in Telex happens through two main interfaces: **channels** and **direct messages**.
- In channels, you can activate one or more agents to handle specific responsibilities and interact with your team.
- Through direct messages, you can engage with AI coworkers one-on-one for focused tasks or private workflows.

**Agents are:**

* **Configurable**: You define their role, tone, and task list
* **Skillful**: They use integrations (called skills) to perform actions


### Agent Tasks 

Tasks are the foundation of agent behavior. You configure what your agent should do using a clear, structured task list — no coding required.
Each task is powered by an internal workflow, but you don’t need to manage that directly. You focus on defining the task list for your agent, and Telex handles the orchestration behind the scenes.

For example, a blogger agent might have the following task list:
- Suggest trending topics
- Generate article outlines
- Create header images
- Analyze SEO performance

You define the tasks. Telex runs the workflows. Your agent delivers the results.

### Agent Skills

Skills are modular tools that agents use to complete tasks. These are custom integrations built for specific purposes, and you can assign multiple skills to an agent depending on its role.

While tasks define what your agent should do, skills define how it gets done.
A blogger agent might use:
- A topic discovery skill
- An image generation skill
- An SEO analyzer skill

Skills can be internal utilities, external APIs, or even LLM-powered sub-agents — all working together to support your AI coworker.

### Having Your First Chat
Once your organization is set up, you can create and configure agents with task lists and skills. Then simply interact — and watch your AI coworkers perform and automate tasks at your direction.
