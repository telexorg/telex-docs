# Welcome to Telex

Telex is an AI and Human collaborative workspace for modern organizations. Whether you're running a tech startup, a logistics firm, a healthcare provider, or a government agency — Telex helps you streamline operations, automate tasks, and coordinate teams through intelligent agents called **AI coworkers**. At its core, Telex is meant for collaboration though **channels** and **direct messages**. To extend these and provide organizations with easier ways of executing day to day taasks, Telex provides organizations with AI Agents to perform and automate these daily tasks on their behalf.

Telex is not just about automation — it’s about **delegation**. It provides collaboration not just between humans but with AI Agents. You define what needs to happen, and your AI coworker takes care of it.


## Agents - The Core of Telex

Telex is a workspace for both humans and intelligent agents — AI coworkers that work alongside your team to perform and automate tasks, manage data, and support operations across your organization. They are called co-workers because you can just interact with them the same way you do a human colleague.
Each AI coworker is designed with a clear purpose and a structured task list and skill. You define what they do, how they behave, and what tools they use. Whether you're running a media company, a logistics firm, or a government agency, Telex lets you delegate work to agents that never sleep, forget, or burn out. These agents performs tasks on your behalf. You give it a role, a personality, and a task list and equip it with the necessary skills — and it gets to work.

Each AI coworker is:
- Role-driven: You define its job (e.g., blogger, analyst, recruiter)
- Task-configured: You specify what it should do
- Skill-enabled: You equip it with tools to complete tasks
- Autonomous: It responds to data, prompts, and events in real time

## Human and Agent Collaboration

Collaboration in Telex happens through two main ways -- channels and Direct messages. Inside each channel, you can deploy one or more agents designed to handle specific responsibilities or you can choose to interact with the agents through direct messages.

**Agents are:**

* **Configurable**: You define their role, tone, and task list
* **Skillful**: They use integrations (called skills) to perform actions


### Tasks - Your Agent Behavior

Tasks are the building blocks of agent behavior. You configure what your agent should do, when, and how — using a clear, structured task list. They are the core of your agent’s behavior. You don’t need to write code or design workflows — just list what your agent should do, and Telex handles the orchestration behind the scenes. You add an agent and define its tasks and it runs a workflow to perform your task using this task list you specified.

Each task is run using a workflow, but you don’t need to manage that directly. You focus on the **task configuration** — Telex handles the orchestration.


### Skills - Your Agent Capabilities

Skills are modular tools that agents use to complete tasks. You can assign multiple skills to an agent. These skills are custom integrations built for specific purposes depending on their use cases. While tasks define what your agent should do, skills equip your AI Coworker with the capabilities it needs to perform its task.

They can include:
- API integrations
- Internal utilities
- LLM-powered sub-agents

You assign skills based on the tasks your agent needs to perform. For example, a blogger agent might use:
- A topic discovery skill
- An image generation skill
- An seo-analyzer skill


## Getting Started

Here’s how to launch your first intelligent channel:

1. Sign up at **[telex.im](https://telex.im/auth/sign-up)**
2. Create your **organization**
3. Set up a **channel** for your team or project
4. Add an **agent** with a defined role and personality
5. Configure **tasks** and assign relevant **skills**
6. Start sending data or chatting with your agent

### Interacting with Agents

Once you have created an organization on Telex, you can create and configure your agents with a task list and necessary skills. You can then interact with them and watch as they perform and automate tasks at your behest.
