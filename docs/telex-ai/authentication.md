#  AI API Authentication

All requests to Telex AI require an API key for secure access. This key should be included in the request headers of every API call.

Visit [Authentication](../agents/authentication) to learn how to get your API key.

### Usage Format

All authenticated requests include this header:

**Header:** 
```http
X-AGENT-API-KEY : your-key
```


**Example (using curl)**

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.telex.im/api/v1/telexai/models \
  -H "X-AGENT-API-KEY: 123xyz"
```


:::note
Never share your agent key in public code or frontend applications.
