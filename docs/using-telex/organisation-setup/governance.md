# Governance & Maintenance

Once your organization is up and running with Telex, it’s important to maintain clarity, control, and consistency. This guide outlines how to govern agent behavior, manage workspace settings, and keep your environment healthy as your team grows.


## Monitor Agent Behavior

Agents evolve with usage. Regularly review how they’re performing:

- Are they responding accurately?
- Are users engaging with them consistently?
- Are they aligned with their intended role?

If needed, update system prompts, adjust roles, or retire agents that no longer serve a purpose.


## Update Roles and Permissions

As your team changes, so should your access model:

- Promote contributors to managers when responsibilities grow
- Reassign roles for new hires or shifting teams
- Remove inactive users to maintain security and clarity

Refer to [Role Configuration](./roles_permissions.md) for guidance.


## Maintain Agent Configuration

When Tasks and Skills become available, you’ll be able to:

- Add or remove modular skills based on team needs
- Define task lists to guide agent workflows
- Version agent configurations for better control

Plan for modularity and revisit agent setups as your workflows evolve.


## Keep Your Workspace Clean

A tidy workspace improves usability:

- Archive unused channels
- Retire outdated agents
- Consolidate redundant threads
- Review notification settings for relevance


## Encourage Feedback

Governance isn’t just top-down — involve your team:

- Ask for feedback on agent usefulness
- Encourage suggestions for new agents or workflows
- Use insights to guide future updates
