# Team Rollout

Rolling out Telex to your team is more than just inviting users — it’s about introducing a new way of working. This guide helps organizations onboard their teams with clarity, confidence, and momentum.

Whether you're launching Telex across a department or piloting it with a small group, the goal is to make adoption smooth and meaningful.


## Launch Strategy

Start with a focused rollout:
- Choose a small team or project group to pilot Telex
- Introduce one or two agents with clear use cases
- Gather feedback and refine before scaling

Avoid launching everything at once — gradual adoption builds trust and clarity.


## Communicate the Value

Help your team understand why Telex matters:
- Share how agents can save time or reduce manual work
- Highlight use cases relevant to their roles
- Show examples of agent responses or workflows

Use internal channels (e.g. #announcements) to introduce agents and share tips.


## Encourage Exploration

Let users try agents in low-pressure environments:
- Use direct messages for testing and prototyping
- Create a dedicated #agent-playground channel
- Encourage questions, feedback, and experimentation

Early engagement helps shape better agent behavior and builds user confidence.


## Provide Support

Make it easy for users to get help:
- Link to documentation and best practices
- Offer short demos or walkthroughs
- Assign a point person (e.g. workspace admin) for questions

Support drives adoption — especially in the first few weeks.


## Monitor Engagement

Track how your team is using Telex:
- Are agents being mentioned in channels?
- Are users interacting in DMs?
- Are workflows improving?

Use this insight to refine prompts, adjust roles, and plan future agents.
