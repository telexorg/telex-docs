# Inviting Team Members

Telex makes it easy to onboard your team and assign roles that match their responsibilities. This guide walks through how to invite members into your organization, manage their access, and configure roles using the built-in user management tools.


## Accessing User Management

To invite or manage users:

1. Click the **Settings icon** in the sidebar.
2. In the **Settings menu**, scroll to the **Organization section** (beneath Personal).
3. Select **User Management** — this opens a dashboard in the main view.

From here, you can:
- View all members in your organization
- Edit or delete users
- Assign or change roles
- Access the **Invite** button in the top-right corner


## Inviting Members

Clicking the **Invite** button opens the **Invite Your Team** form. You’ll see two tabs:

### Invite Few
Use this tab to invite individuals manually:
- Enter their email address
- Select a role from the dropdown
- Click **Add Row** to invite multiple people
- Use **Send Invite** to finalize

You can also click **Copy Invite Link** to share a generic invite that assigns the **User** role by default.

### Invite Many *(if available)*
Use this tab to bulk import users via CSV or other supported formats.


## Role Assignment

When inviting users, you can assign one of the following roles:

| Role          | Access Level         | Key Permissions |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Administrator** | Full control | Manage users, billing, webhooks, channels |
| **Manager**       | Approve & manage | Invite, remove, create roles, view billing |
| **Project Lead**  | Coordinate & oversee | Manage users, channels, roles |
| **User**          | Read & write | Create channels, comment, invite |
| **Guest**         | Read-only | View channels only |

Refer to [Role Configuration](./roles_permissions.md) for a full breakdown.


## Best Practices

- Use **Invite Few** for precise role assignment.
- Use **Copy Invite Link** for quick onboarding with default access.
- Review roles regularly to ensure proper access control.
- Remove inactive users to keep your workspace clean.
