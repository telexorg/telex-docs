## Role Impact on Agent Interaction

- **Creating Agents**: Reserved for Administrators and Managers.
- **Using Agents in DMs**: Depends on role and workspace permissions.
- **Mentioning Agents in Channels**: Available to Users, Managers, and Project Leads if the agent is present and permissions allow.

## Assigning Roles

Roles are assigned during [member invitation](invite-team.md) or updated by Administrators. Use roles to reflect team structure and maintain clarity across your workspace.

## Best Practices

- Limit Administrator access to trusted leads.
- Use Manager and Project Lead roles for operational oversight.
- Assign User roles for day-to-day contributors.
- Use Guest roles for external or view-only participants.
- Review roles periodically as your team evolves.
