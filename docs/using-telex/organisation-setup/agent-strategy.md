# Agent Strategy

Agents in Telex are powerful digital teammates â€” but their impact depends on how well theyâ€™re scoped, configured, and deployed. This guide helps organizations plan their agent strategy with clarity and purpose.

Whether you're building your first agent or scaling across departments, the goal is to create agents that solve real problems, align with workflows, and deliver measurable value.


## ðŸŽ¯ Start with Use Cases

Identify where agents can make the biggest impact. Common starting points include:

- **Support Agents**  
  Answer questions, resolve issues, and guide users through processes.

- **Content Agents**  
  Draft emails, announcements, reports, or onboarding materials.

- **Lead Generation Agents**  
  Qualify prospects, collect information, and route leads.

- **Ops Agents**  
  Summarize threads, track updates, or surface insights.

Choose use cases that are:
- Repetitive or time-consuming
- High-volume or high-impact
- Easy to scope and measure


## Define Agent Roles Thoughtfully

Each agent should have a clear role and personality. Ask:
- What is this agent responsible for?
- How should it speak or behave?
- What tone fits the team it serves?

Use the system prompt to define its voice, boundaries, and behavior.


## Plan for Modularity

As Tasks and Skills become available, agents will support modular configuration. Plan ahead by thinking in components:
- What actions should this agent be able to perform?
- What workflows should it follow?
- What skills will make it more effective?


## Prototype Before Scaling

Start small:
- Build one agent for a single use case
- Test in direct messages
- Gather feedback from early users

Once behavior is predictable and useful, deploy in channels and scale across teams.


## Measure and Iterate

Track how agents are used:
- Are they responding accurately?
- Are they saving time or improving outcomes?
- Are users engaging with them consistently?

Use this feedback to refine prompts, adjust roles, and plan future agents.
