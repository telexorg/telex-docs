# Introduction

Telex is built for teams â€” and setting up your organization correctly is key to unlocking its full potential. This guide walks through how to structure your workspace, assign roles, create agents strategically, and onboard your team with confidence.

Whether you're a startup deploying your first agent or an enterprise rolling out Telex across departments, this section will help you build a strong foundation.


## Setting Up Your Organization

Before inviting your team, make sure your workspace reflects your structure:

- **Workspace Name & Branding**  
  Choose a name that reflects your team or department. Add a logo and description to personalize your space.

- **Channel Strategy**  
  Create channels based on workflows, teams, or topics. Decide where agents will be active and how theyâ€™ll contribute.

- **Role Configuration**  
  Assign roles (admin, contributor, member) based on responsibilities. Roles determine who can create agents, manage channels, and interact in DMs.


## Planning Your Agent Strategy

Agents are powerful â€” but theyâ€™re most effective when purpose-built. Start with:

- **Use Case Mapping**  
  Identify key workflows that could benefit from automation or AI support (e.g. support, content creation, lead generation).

- **Agent Prioritization**  
  Build agents that solve immediate problems first. Keep scope focused and behavior predictable.

- **Prompt Design**  
  Write clear system prompts that define the agentâ€™s tone, role, and boundaries.



## ðŸ‘¥ Onboarding Your Team

Once your workspace and agents are ready, bring your team in:

- **Invite Members**  
  Use the workspace invite flow to add teammates. Assign roles based on their function.

- **Introduce Agents**  
  Share examples of what agents can do. Encourage interaction in low-stakes channels or DMs.

- **Provide Guidance**  
  Link to documentation, share best practices, and offer tips on how to communicate with agents effectively.


## Maintaining Your Workspace

Keep things running smoothly with regular check-ins:

- **Review Agent Behavior**  
  Monitor how agents respond and adjust prompts or roles as needed.

- **Update Skills & Tasks** *(when available)*  
  Add or remove capabilities based on evolving needs.

- **Archive Unused Agents**  
  Keep your workspace clean by retiring agents that are no longer relevant.
