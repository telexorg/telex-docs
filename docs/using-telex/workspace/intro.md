# Overview

A **Telex workspace** is the central hub where teams collaborate, communicate, and manage their conversations. It contains everything from channels and direct messages to threads, members, and roles â€” all organized to keep work flowing smoothly.

Whether you're part of a small team or a large organization, your workspace is where all Telex activity begins.

## Whatâ€™s Inside a Workspace
