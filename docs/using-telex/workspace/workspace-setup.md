# Workspace Setup

Before your team can collaborate or deploy agents, your Telex workspace needs to be properly structured. This page walks through the key elements of workspace setup — from naming and branding to channel organization and foundational roles.

## Naming and Branding

Give your workspace a clear identity:
- **Workspace Name**: Choose something recognizable to your team or department.
- **Logo and Description**: Add a visual and short description to personalize your space and help users orient themselves.

## Channel Structure

Channels are the backbone of collaboration in Telex. Organize them based on:
- **Teams** (e.g. #marketing, #support)
- **Projects** (e.g. #launch-campaign, #product-feedback)
- **Functions** (e.g. #announcements, #agent-testing)

Decide early which channels will host agents and how they’ll contribute.

## Role Assignment

Assign initial roles to key team members:
- **Admins**: Can configure workspace settings, manage roles, and create agents.
- **Contributors**: Can interact with agents and participate in channels.
- **Members**: Can view and engage, but may have limited creation permissions.

Refer to [Roles & Permissions](../organisation-setup/role-permission.md) for a full breakdown.

## Workspace Defaults

Set up workspace-wide preferences:
- Notification settings
- Default channel visibility
- Agent interaction permissions

These defaults help streamline onboarding and ensure consistency across teams.
