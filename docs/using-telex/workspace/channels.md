# Channels

**Channels** are shared spaces within a Telex workspace where members — including agents — collaborate around specific topics, teams, or workflows. They keep conversations organized, searchable, and actionable.

Whether you're discussing product updates, coordinating logistics, or triggering automated workflows, channels are where it all happens.


## Types of Channels

- **Public Channels**  
  Open to all workspace members. Anyone can join and participate.

- **Private Channels**  
  Restricted to invited members only. Useful for sensitive discussions or focused teams.


##  Agents in Channels

Agents can be added to channels just like human members. Once present, they can:

- Listen for specific triggers or keywords
- Respond with automated messages or actions
- Interact with threads, files, and mentions
- Execute workflows based on channel activity

> 💡 Example: An agent in `#support` might auto-reply to common questions or escalate issues to a human.


## What You Can Do in a Channel

- Send messages, files, and mentions
- Start and follow threads
- React to messages with emojis
- Pin important updates
- View channel history and search past conversations
- Manage channel settings and permissions

1. Click the **“+”** icon next to the Channels list.
2. Choose a name and description.
