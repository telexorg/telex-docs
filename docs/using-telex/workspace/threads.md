# Threads

**Threads** in Telex keep conversations focused and organized by allowing users ‚Äî and agents ‚Äî to reply directly to specific messages. Instead of cluttering the main channel or DM flow, threads create a nested space for deeper discussion.

Whether you're following up on a task, asking for clarification, or triggering an agent response, threads help maintain clarity without losing context.

## What Is a Thread?

A thread is a group of replies attached to a single parent message. It appears inline but expands into its own view when clicked ‚Äî showing all related replies, reactions, and mentions.


## Who Can Use Threads

- **Workspace members** ‚Äî reply, react, mention, and follow threads.
- **Agents (AI coworkers)** ‚Äî respond to thread messages, trigger workflows, or provide contextual assistance.

> üí° Example: An agent in `#support` might reply in a thread with a suggested solution or escalate the issue automatically.


## What You Can Do in a Thread

- Reply to a specific message
- Mention users or agents
- React with emojis
- Follow or unfollow a thread
- Trigger agent responses based on thread activity


## Notifications and Unread Tracking

- You‚Äôll be notified when someone replies to a thread you follow.
- Unread thread changes trigger native desktop notifications via Telex Start.
- Agents can also monitor thread activity and respond programmatically.


## Starting a Thread

To start a thread:

1. Hover over a message.
2. Click the **‚ÄúReply in thread‚Äù** icon.
3. Type your response and hit **Enter**.
4. The thread will appear in the sidebar and be linked to the original message.


## Thread Visibility

- Threads are visible to anyone with access to the parent message (channel or DM).
- Replies are stored and searchable within the thread view.
- Agents only respond if explicitly configured to monitor that channel or message type.
