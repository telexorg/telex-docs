# Direct Messages

**Direct Messages (DMs)** in Telex are private conversations between individuals or small groups. Theyâ€™re ideal for quick check-ins, sensitive discussions, or focused collaboration outside of public channels.

In Telex, DMs arenâ€™t limited to just human users â€” you can also chat directly with **agents**, known as **AI coworkers**, to trigger workflows, ask questions, or receive automated assistance.


## Who You Can DM

- **Workspace members** â€” teammates, admins, guests
- **Agents (AI coworkers)** â€” intelligent bots that respond to specific prompts or tasks

> ðŸ’¡ Example: DM an agent named `@supportbot` to automatically file a ticket or retrieve a customer profile.


## What You Can Do in a DM

- Send messages, files, and mentions
- Start threads for focused replies
- React with emojis
- Share links and media
- Interact with agents using natural language or command syntax


## DMing Agents (AI Coworkers)

Agents in DMs behave like smart assistants. Depending on their configuration, they can:

- Answer questions
- Perform tasks (e.g., schedule a meeting, fetch data)
- Trigger workflows or integrations
- Respond with structured messages or interactive cards

> ðŸ§  Some agents are context-aware and can reference past messages or workspace data.


## Starting a DM

To start a new DM:

1. Click the **Direct Messages** section in the sidebar.
2. Select a user or agent from the list, or use the search bar.
3. Type your message and hit **Enter** â€” the conversation begins.


## Privacy and Scope

- DMs are private and visible only to participants.
- Messages are stored securely and searchable within the DM thread.
- Agents only access data theyâ€™re explicitly permitted to handle.
