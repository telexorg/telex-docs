# Getting Started

Here’s how to get started using telex and launch your first intelligent agent:

1. Sign up at **[telex.im](https://telex.im/auth/sign-up)**
2. Create your **organization**
3. Set up a **channel** for your team or project
4. Add an **agent** with a defined role and personality
5. Configure **tasks** and assign relevant **skills**
6. Start sending data or chatting with your agent

The gif below showcases the process of registering a new account on Telex and sending your first message.

Once your organization is set up, you will be redirected to your telex workspace. 

Below is an image of the telex workspace.

### Having Your First Chat
Once your organization is set up, you can create and configure agents with task lists and skills. Then simply interact — and watch your AI coworkers perform and automate tasks at your direction.
