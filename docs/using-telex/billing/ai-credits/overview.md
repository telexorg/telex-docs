# What Are Credits

Telex uses a credit-based system to power agent interactions and other usage-based features. Credits allow organizations to scale agent activity while maintaining control over cost and performance.

## What Are Credits Used For?

Credits are consumed when agents perform tasks such as:

- Responding to messages in channels or DMs  
- Summarizing threads or generating content  
- Sending notifications or alerts  
- Executing skills *(when available)*  

Each action draws from your credit balance based on usage patterns and workspace configuration.

## Why Use a Credit System?

Credits give organizations:

- **Flexibility**: Pay only for what you use  
- **Scalability**: Add agents and increase usage as needed  
- **Transparency**: Track consumption and forecast costs  
- **Control**: Set limits and receive usage alerts  

This system ensures that agent activity remains efficient, measurable, and cost-effective.


## Credit Limits and Notifications

Your workspace includes:

- A **credit balance** visible always at the top right corner of the workspace
- **Usage tracking** to monitor daily and cumulative consumption  
- **Notifications** when usage approaches your limit  

> Admins should always monitor and configure top-up credits to avoid service interruptions.
