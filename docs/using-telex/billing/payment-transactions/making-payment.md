# Making a Payment

Once you've selected a **subscription plan** or an **AI credit pack**, you're redirected to the payment interface to complete your purchase. This page outlines what you'll see and how to finalize the transaction.


## Billing Summary

At the top of the payment page, you'll see a summary of what you're about to pay for:

- **Plan name** (e.g. Enterprise Plan) or **Credit pack** (e.g. Pro Bundle)  
- **Price** (e.g. $1,000/month or $25 for 5,000 credits)  
- **Description** of included features or limits  
- Your **account email** (pre-filled)

This ensures transparency before you proceed with payment.


## Payment Options

You’ll be presented with two primary payment paths:

### 1. **Cash App Pay**
- For users with a Cash App account
- Quick checkout via QR code or mobile app

### 2. **Card Checkout**
Supports:
- Credit/debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover)  
- **Link**  
- **Amazon Pay**

Card checkout fields include:
- Card number  
- Expiration date (MM/YY)  
- CVC  
- Cardholder name  
- Country or region  
- Optional: **Save my information for faster checkout**


## Finalizing the Payment

Once your details are filled in:

- Click the **Subscribe** or **Buy Credits** button  
- Payment is securely processed via **Stripe**  
- You’ll be automatically redirected to the **Billing dashboard** — no success message is shown


## After Payment

- Your **plan or credit balance** updates immediately  
- The transaction appears in your **Payment History**  
- You can view and download the invoice from the action column


## Best Practices

- Use a corporate card with sufficient authorization  
- Double-check card details and billing address
