# How Payments Work

Telex uses a unified payment system for both subscription plans and AI credit purchases. This section explains how payments are processed, what to expect during checkout, and how to confirm successful transactions.


## What Can You Pay For?

You can make payments for:

- **Subscription Plans**: Upgrading from Free to Business or Enterprise
- **AI Credits**: Purchasing additional credits for agent usage

Both follow the same secure payment flow.


## Payment Flow

1. Initiate a purchase from the **Billing dashboard**
2. Select your item (plan or credit bundle)
3. Enter payment details (card info, billing address)
4. Confirm the transaction
5. Receive a confirmation and updated billing status


## What Happens After Payment

- Your plan or credit balance updates immediately
- A receipt is emailed to your billing contact
- The transaction appears in your **Payment History**
- You can view and download the invoice

## Troubleshooting Payments

If a payment fails:

- Double-check card details and billing address
- Ensure your role is **Administrator** or **Manager**
- Retry the transaction or use a different card
- Contact support with the invoice or transaction ID
