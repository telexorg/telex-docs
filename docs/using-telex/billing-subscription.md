# Billing & Subscription

Telex offers flexible billing options to support organizations of all sizes. This guide explains how billing works, who can manage it, and how to view or upgrade your subscription plan.


## Who Can Access Billing

Only users with the **Administrator** or **Manager** role can view and manage billing settings. These roles can:

- View current subscription plan
- Access billing history and invoices
- Update payment method
- Modify subscription tier


## Subscription Plans

Telex offers three subscription tiers. You can toggle between **monthly** and **annual** billing in the Billing dashboard.

| Plan            | Monthly Price | User Capacity | Credit Limit | Notifications         |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Free**        | $0             | 300 users      | 1K credits       | Credit + Upgrade alerts |
| **Business**    | $50            | 500 users      | 10K credits    | Credit + Upgrade alerts |
| **Enterprise**  | $1000          | 1K users       | 1M credits     | Credit + Upgrade alerts |

To upgrade:
- Go to **Settings ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Billing**
- Click the upgrade button for your desired plan (e.g. ‚ÄúUpgrade to Indie Business‚Äù)

Each plan includes access to core Telex features, with increasing limits on users and credits. Credits may be used for agent interactions, notifications, or other usage-based features.


## Updating Payment Information

Admins and Managers can update payment details at any time:

- Add or replace credit card
- Update billing address
- Set invoice recipients

Changes take effect immediately and are reflected in the next billing cycle.


## Viewing Usage & Invoices

The Billing dashboard includes:

- Current usage metrics (agents, users, workspace size)
- Invoice history with downloadable receipts
- Upcoming charges and renewal dates

Use this data to monitor growth and adjust your plan as needed.


## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

- Assign billing access only to trusted roles
- Review usage monthly to avoid overages
- Keep payment info up to date to prevent service interruptions
- Use invoice history for internal reporting or audits
