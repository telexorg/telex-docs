# Interval Custom Agent - Uptime Monitor

This page explains how to create a custom agent for a website uptime monitor. The agent will check the status of a website at set intervals and post the result to the Telex channel where is it activated.

---

## 1. Creating the Project

First things first, let's set up our Python environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### Step 1: Initialize the Project

Start by creating a new directory for your project and setting up a virtual environment:

```bash
mkdir uptime-monitor
cd uptime-monitor
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

We'll use FastAPI for our application:

```bash
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
```

### Step 3: Create the main python file

Create a file named `main.py` where we'll write our integration logic:

```bash
touch main.py
```

Now weâ€™re ready to write some code.

## 2. Adding the `/integration.json` Endpoint

Telex agents are implemented as web services and must expose a route that returns their JSON schema. This schema defines all the important data Telex needs to interact with the agent. Refer to the [Creating Agents](/docs/Integrations/creating_integration) guide for more information.

Open `main.md` and start with this code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import FileResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/integration.json")
def get_integration_json(request: Request):
    base_url = str(request.base_url).rstrip("/")
    return {
        "data": {
            "descriptions": {
                "app_name": "Uptime Monitor",
                "app_description": "Monitors website uptime",
                "app_url": base_url,
                "app_logo": "https://i.imgur.com/lZqvffp.png",
                "background_color": "#fff"
            },
            "integration_type": "interval",
            "settings": [
                {"label": "site-1", "type": "text", "required": True, "default": ""},
                {"label": "site-2", "type": "text", "required": True, "default": ""},
                {"label": "interval", "type": "text", "required": True, "default": "* * * * *"}
            ],
            "tick_url": f"{base_url}/tick"
        }
    }
```

The agent integration type is defined as `interval`, and we've added three settings:

1. `site-1` and `site-2` are text fields for the URLs of the websites to monitor. You can add more sites as needed. More sites will mean more checks for this agent, so add them wisely if you do not have a lot of resources.
2. `interval` is a text field for the cron expression defining the interval.

### Run the Server

Start your server to test the endpoint:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/integration.json` and verify the JSON response.

## 3. Adding the functions for monitoring

We'll define the `MonitorPayload` class and implement the endpoint:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks
import httpx
import asyncio

class Setting(BaseModel):
    label: str
    type: str
    required: bool
    default: str

class MonitorPayload(BaseModel):
    channel_id: str
    return_url: str
    settings: List[Setting]

async def check_site_status(site: str) -> str:
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(site, timeout=10)
            if response.status_code < 400:
                return None
            return f"{site} is down (status {response.status_code})"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"{site} check failed: {str(e)}"

async def monitor_task(payload: MonitorPayload):
    sites = [s.default for s in payload.settings if s.label.startswith("site")]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*(check_site_status(site) for site in sites))

    message = "\n".join([result for result in results if result is not None])

    # data follows telex webhook format. Your integration must call the return_url using this format
    data = {
        "message": message,
        "username": "Uptime Monitor",
        "event_name": "Uptime Check",
        "status": "error"
    }

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        await client.post(payload.return_url, json=data)

```

## 4. Adding the `/tick` Endpoint

Telex maintains the clock time for interval integration agents. When the defined interval is reached, Telex will call the `/tick` endpoint to initiate uptime checks. This endpoint should expect a POST request with the payload containing the channel ID, return URL, and settings. Telex will send these details to the endpoint when it's time to check the uptime. The handler for this endpoint should generally do its processing in the background so that it can handle new requests quickly. This also gives it time to complete its processing before sending the response back to Telex via the return URL.

```py

from fastapi import BackgroundTasks

@app.post("/tick", status_code=202)
def monitor(payload: MonitorPayload, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(monitor_task, payload)
    return {"status": "accepted"}
```

---

### Testing the Integration

Use `curl` or Postman to send a test request to `/tick`. Ensure you replace `<your-test-telex-channel-id>` with a test actual Telex channel ID. Note that this demonstration is for testing purposes. Telex will send the actual channel ID and return URL when the integration is activated on a channel and the interval is reached.

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8000/tick' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "channel_id": "<your-test-telex-channel-id>",
    "return_url": "https://ping.telex.im/v1/return/<your-test-telex-channel-id>",
    "settings": [
        {
            "label": "site-1",
            "type": "text",
            "required": true,
            "default": "https://google.com"
        },
        {
            "label": "site-2",
            "default": "https://www.somefakewebsitethatisfake.com",
            "type": "text",
            "required": true
        },
        {
            "label": "interval",
            "type": "text",
            "required": true,
            "default": "* * * * *"
        }
    ]
}'
```

If everything is done correctly, you should see a new uptime check on the Telex channel you specified.

## 4. Hosting and further tests

Host the application on a server so you can add it to your Telex organization. You can use hosting service with a generous free offering like Render or fly.io. Once hosted, add the integration to your organization's Apps page with the `<your-hosted-url>/integration.json` URL. Afterwards, proceed to activate it, and configure it. Add the sites you wish to monitor and set the interval.
